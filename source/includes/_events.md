The event record is used for a adding races and events to the system.

Users of the system can add these event's to their calendar, and in most cases they can also build a training plan from the event.

The basic model for the event is that the event has 1 or more courses. 

If the event is a stage race, then each day would have a course entry.

If the event is a series races, then each race in the series would have a course entry.

For single day races, multiple courses are possible - ie there is a 50km and 100km option.

<aside class="notice">
The ability to add, edit and remove events is limited to those who have a *company* role, or *power* role.
</aside>

The following sequence should be used for creating events;

* Create the event promotor company (if it does not yet exist in the system)
* Create the event, associating it with the company
* Create the venues where each course / stage will occur (if they do not yet exist in the system)
* Create the courses for the event, associating the course with the event and the venue
